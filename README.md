## 🚀 About Me
I’m a blockchain developer focused on **protocol design**, infrastructure engineering, and scaling solutions for decentralized systems.

**I am currently a Blockchain Engineer at Tokamak Network**, where I contribute to the development of modular infrastructure and Layer 2 scaling solutions. I’ve built full-stack Web3 applications, explored **rollup architectures** and ZK proving systems, and contributed across multiple ecosystems and toolchains.

### Key Areas of Deep Dive:
- 🔬 **Modular Scaling:** Modular rollups, decentralized sequencer design, and zkEVM constraint systems.
- ⚡ **Interoperability & Infra:** Cross-chain tooling, Shared Sequencer models, and integration with modular DA layers.
- 🧪 **Zero-Knowledge:** zk circuits, proving backends.
- ⚙️ **Developer Experience:** Rapid prototyping and testing.
